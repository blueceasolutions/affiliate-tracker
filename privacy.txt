Refund Policy
Last Updated: February 11, 2026
At Clariolane, we strive to provide the best tools for speed reading and comprehension.
Because our service is a digital product provided instantly upon payment, our refund policy is as
follows:
●
●
●
●
Subscription Renewals: You may cancel your monthly subscription at any time. To
avoid being charged for the next billing cycle, you must cancel at least 24 hours before
your renewal date.
Partial Months: We do not offer prorated refunds for mid-month cancellations. If you
cancel early, you will continue to have full access to Clariolane features until the end of
your current 30-day billing period.
Refund Requests: Refunds are generally not granted once a billing cycle has been
processed. However, if you believe there has been a technical error or an unauthorized
charge, please contact us at support@clariolane.com within 7 days of the transaction,
and we will investigate.
Referral Earnings: Refunded subscriptions do not count toward referral earnings. If a
referred user’s payment is refunded or charged back, the $1.50 commission will be
deducted from the referrer's dashboard.
Referral Program FAQ
How do I make money with Clariolane? Every user gets a unique referral link in their
dashboard. Share this link with friends, students, or colleagues. When someone signs up and
subscribes for $5, you earn $1.50.
How do I track my earnings? Your Referral Dashboard shows real-time stats, including:
●
●
●
Total clicks on your link.
Number of successful (paid) subscribers.
Your current withdrawable balance.
When can I withdraw my money? Once your balance hits the $10 minimum, a "Withdraw"
button will be activated in your dashboard.
How are payments sent? Payouts are processed via [e.g., Bank Transfer / PayStack
Payout]. Please ensure your payment details are correctly filled out in your profile settings.
(Note: Payouts are usually processed within 3–5 business days).
Is the commission recurring? No. The $1.50 is a one-time reward for the initial signup. You do
not receive additional payments when the user renews their subscription for the second month.
What if my friend forgot to use my link? Our system uses cookies to track your referrals. If a
user does not use your specific link to sign up, the system cannot attribute the sale to you. We
cannot manually add referrals to your account after a signup is complete.
Active Account Requirement: To be eligible to receive referral payouts, you must maintain an
active, paid subscription. Any referrals generated or completed during a period when your
account is deactivated, expired, or cancelled will not be credited to your dashboard or count
toward your earnings.
